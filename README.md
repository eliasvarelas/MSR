# Multiple Sclerosis Registry
Multiple Sclerosis Registry created to serve neurologists with Multiple Sclerosis patients. Also Thesis subject for my university graduation.
## Description
The project located here was created by a neurologists' request for an online platform where they can enter/maintain/edit their patients data related to the neurodegenerative disease of Multiple Sclerosis. It is aimed for a multi-user experience, with specific credentials for each user/doctor and admins. It gives each doctor the ability to keep a record of the patients he-she is overseeing, add-remove patients at his-her will, add followup visits for each patient, program and keep track of his-her appointments with a callendar function, have access at any time to the patients' medical history, perform basic patient searching based on the patients' name, or advanced patient searching based on specified attributes that may be important at the moment. Also the doctors and the admins have the ability to create graphs and charts for the attributes that they are intrested in.
